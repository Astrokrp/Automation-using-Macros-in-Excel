* Developed VBA scripts that records macros in Microsoft Excel and automates the report generation process for supply-chain operations in Countdown Supermarkets.
* Implemented replications of the VBA scripts to minimize the workload in Excel Sheets.

* You can inspect the code and ask me questions. contact me at phy.astrokrp@outlook.com

## IMPORTANT NOTE: The attached VBA script would not work if you implement directly to your computer because it was scripted specifically for the confidential sheets. also, uploded file strictly demonstrates my knowledge in VBA and Excel and There is no other purpose relates to this repository.
